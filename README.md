### All the problems are tested in TestProblems.java

### for Problem 1 
   - we are printing regex pattern and its matching strinng list, as we can use this in the next threads question
     ( not printing as in the mentioned format i.e 'String: 1 mathes with regex 1' )
   - we taking all the matching strings into account
   
### for Probelm 2
   - we are assuming the job (fiding regex match takes time) takes much time, as in real life we use threads & thread pools for CPU intensive 	   tasks
   
### for Problem 4
   - shell script file is incleded in the answers folder ( within project folder )
   -the shell script is tested on the Ubuntu 20.04
